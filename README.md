### Rules and Hints
- Please consider those requirements as basic. We value a good code structure or additional functionalities.
- During implementing the assignment use many different and appropriate layers (i.e. middleware), design patterns (i.e. serializers), and so on.
- Donâ€™t forget to test appropriate amount of code.
- Usage of latest ECMAScript/TypeScript standard and features is encouraged.
- The application's code should be kept in a public repository so that we can read it, pull it and build it ourselves. Remember to include README file or at least basic notes on application requirements and setup - we should be able to easily and quickly get it running.
- Please dockerize your application.
- Written application must be hosted and publicly available for us online - we recommend Heroku.
